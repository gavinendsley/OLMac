\
C. Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or materials from third parties (\'93Third Party Materials\'94) or provide links to certain third party web sites.

D. Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data provided by any Services is for basic navigational purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. Neither Apple nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services. \
\
E. You agree that the Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Apple and/or its licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright, and that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials in any way whatsoever except for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Apple. No portion of the Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening network capacity.

\

\b 10. Digital Certificates.\

\b0 A. \ul General\ulnone . The Apple Software contains functionality that allows it to accept digital certificates either issued from Apple or from third parties.

\
B. \ul Use of Digital Certificates in iChat\ulnone .
\b  
\b0 The Apple Software allows you to encrypt your iChat communications. This feature uses digital certificates to verify that the iChat is coming from the iChat screen name that appears in the iChat window and to encrypt and decrypt the chat.  It does not verify the identity of the person using that screen name. Apple does not guarantee that there will be no hacking or intrusions into the chat. YOUR USE OF THIS FEATURE IN CONNECTION WITH ICHAT IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. APPLE MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, SECURITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF DIGITAL CERTIFICATES AND/OR ENCRYPTION IN ICHAT. By using the Apple Software, you agree that (a) you will take no action that interferes with the normal operation of digital certificates or encryption used in an iChat session or otherwise falsify the digital certificate used to validate a screen name; (b) you will use the encrypted iChat function solely for legal purposes; (c) you are solely responsible for preventing any unauthorized user from having access to any certificate or private key stored on your computer; and (d) you will revoke any certificate that you have reason to believe is compromised.
