            <div class="AppleTopicBody">
               <div class="Intro">
                  <p class="Para">You can configure Mac OS X to access basic user account information in an Active Directory domain of a Windows 2000 or later
                     server. This is possible because of an Active Directory connector for Directory Utility. This Active Directory connector is
                     listed in the Services pane of Directory Utility.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">You do not need to make schema changes to the Active Directory domain to get basic user account information. You might change
                     the default Access Control List (ACL) of specific attributes so computer accounts can read user properties.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">The Active Directory connector generates all attributes required for Mac OS X authentication from standard attributes in Active
                     Directory user accounts. The connector also supports Active Directory authentication policies, including password changes,
                     expirations, forced changes, and security options.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Mac OS X v10.6 supports packet encryption and packet signing options for all Windows Active Directory domains. This functionality
                     is on by default as “allow.” You can change the default setting to disabled or required by using the <span class="CodeBody">dsconfigad</span> command-line tool. The packet encryption and packet signing options ensures all data to and from the Active Directory Domain
                     for record lookups is protected.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">The Active Directory connector dynamically generates a unique user ID and a primary group ID based on the user account’s Globally
                     Unique ID (GUID) in the Active Directory domain. The generated user ID and primary group ID are the same for each user account,
                     even if the account is used to log in to different Mac OS X computers.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Alternatively, you can force the Active Directory connector to map the user ID to Active Directory attributes that you specify.</p>
                  <p class="Para">The Active Directory connector generates a group ID based on the Active Directory group account’s GUID. You can also force
                     the plug-in to map the group ID for group accounts to Active Directory attributes that you specify.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">When someone logs in to Mac OS X with an Active Directory user account, the Active Directory connector can mount the Windows
                     network home folder specified in the Active Directory user account as the user’s Mac OS X home folder. You can specify whether
                     to use the network home specified by Active Directory’s standard home Directory attribute or by Mac OS X’s home Directory
                     attribute (if the Active Directory schema has been extended to include it).
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Alternatively, you can configure the plug-in to create a local home folder on the startup volume of the Mac OS X client computer.
                     In this case, the plug-in also mounts the user’s Windows network home folder (specified in the Active Directory user account)
                     as a network volume, like a share point. Using the Finder, the user can then copy files between the Windows home folder network
                     volume and the local Mac OS X home folder.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">The Active Directory connector can also create mobile accounts for users. A mobile account has a local home folder on the
                     startup volume of the Mac OS X client computer. (The user also has a network home folder as specified in the user’s Active
                     Directory account).
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">A mobile account caches the user’s Active Directory authentication credentials on the Mac OS X client computer. The cached
                     credentials permit the user to log in using the Active Directory name and password when the client computer is disconnected
                     from the Active Directory server.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">A mobile account has a local home folder on the startup volume of the Mac OS X client computer. (The user also has a network
                     home folder as specified in the user’s Active Directory account.)
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">If the Active Directory schema has been extended to include Mac OS X record types (object classes) and attributes, the Active
                     Directory connector detects and accesses them.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">For example, the Active Directory schema could be changed using Windows administration tools to include Mac OS X managed client
                     attributes. This schema change enables the Active Directory connector to support managed client settings made using Mac OS X
                     Server’s Workgroup Manager application.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Mac OS X clients assume full read access to attributes that are added to the directory. Therefore, it might be necessary to
                     change the ACL of those attributes to permit computer groups to read these added attributes.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">The Active Directory connector discovers all domains in an Active Directory forest. You can configure the plug-in to permit
                     users from any domain in the forest to authenticate on a Mac OS X computer. Alternatively, you can permit only specific domains
                     to be authenticated on the client.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">The Active Directory connector fully supports Active Directory replication and failover. It discovers multiple domain controllers
                     and determines the closest one. If a domain controller becomes unavailable, the plug-in falls back to another nearby domain
                     controller.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">The Active Directory connector uses LDAP to access Active Directory user accounts and Kerberos to authenticate them. The Active
                     Directory connector does not use Microsoft’s proprietary Active Directory Services Interface (ADSI) to get directory or authentication
                     services.
